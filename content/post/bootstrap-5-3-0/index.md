> Finding the right courses at Penn can feel like solving a puzzle—especially when weighing quality, difficulty, and instructor fit. While Penn Course Review offers invaluable data, it’s not always easy to compare options in context.

That’s where our Chrome extension comes in.

This tool allows students to **select two courses directly from Path@Penn**, then instantly receive **side-by-side comparisons** based on **Penn Course Review ratings**. We designed it to ask students what matters most—whether it's a great instructor, manageable workload, or high course quality—and tailor recommendations accordingly.

Our goal was to **eliminate decision fatigue** and **empower students with personalized, data-informed insights**. Behind the scenes, the extension leverages a blend of local storage, user prompts, and intelligent data parsing to improve the course selection journey.

This is just the beginning. Future iterations will introduce historical grade data and peer reviews—because picking your classes shouldn’t be harder than taking them.

> Built for students, by students—because we deserve better tools.
