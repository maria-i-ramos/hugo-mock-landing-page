# User Stories for ClassMatch AI

This is a backlog of user stories for **ClassMatch AI**, a Chrome extension that helps Penn students compare courses using real data from Path@Penn and Penn Course Review. These stories describe both current features and possible future improvements to enhance the user experience and course selection process.

## Current Features

These are features currently implemented or planned for ClassMatch AI and illustrated in the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a student, I want to pull my shortlist of classes from Path@Penn so that I don’t need to manually enter course names.
2. As a student, I want to input what I care about in a class (e.g., light workload, good professor) so that I receive tailored suggestions.
3. As a student, I want the extension to fetch and compare Penn Course Review data so that I don’t have to manually read through reviews.
4. As a student, I want to receive a ranked recommendation list based on my input preferences so that I can make more informed registration decisions.
5. As a student, I want to view a breakdown of why a particular course is recommended so that I can trust the system's decision-making.
6. As a student, I want an intuitive interface that guides me step-by-step through comparison and review so that I don’t feel overwhelmed.

### Other Features

1. As a student, I want to ensure that my selected courses and preferences are saved temporarily so that I can revisit them before finalizing registration.
2. As a student, I want my data to be handled securely without unnecessary collection or sharing so that I can feel safe using the tool.
3. As a student, I want an option to export the analysis (e.g., summary PDF or CSV) so that I can consult it offline or share it with advisors.

## Potential Features Expansion

1. As a student, I want to compare more than two courses at once so that I can evaluate multiple options side-by-side.
2. As a student, I want to receive real-time feedback and prompt adjustments based on my preferences so that I can explore trade-offs interactively.
3. As a student, I want to link Path@Penn schedule constraints with course quality data so that recommendations reflect both timing and preference alignment.
4. As a student, I want to view historical grade distributions or GPA averages for courses to further understand difficulty.
5. As a student, I want to integrate peer comments or quotes from reviews to better understand the tone and culture of a class.
6. As a student, I want to bookmark or favorite courses I'm considering so I can revisit them later without starting over.
7. As a student, I want to rerun comparisons with different preferences so I can evaluate how my priorities affect the recommendations.
8. As a developer, I want to contribute to ClassMatch AI by improving feature logic or adding new metrics, ensuring the tool evolves with community needs.
9. As a student, I want to integrate with Penn Course Plan or other registration tools to streamline the final registration process.
10. As a student, I want to receive optional reminders during add/drop about my previous course analysis to help with final decision-making.
11. As a student, I want to see visual comparisons (e.g., bar charts or radar plots) of selected course metrics so that I can quickly grasp differences between options.
12. As a student, I want to get personalized course suggestions even before selecting specific classes, based on my academic history and review patterns, so I can discover new courses aligned with my interests.
